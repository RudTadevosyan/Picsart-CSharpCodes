# Picsart Academy Projects

This repository contains **study and practice projects** completed during my time at **Picsart Academy**,
including **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, **graph algorithms**, **miscellaneous coding exercises**, and **mini simulation/management systems**.  

The projects demonstrate hands-on experience with C# programming, object-oriented design, and practical problem-solving.

## Project Categories

### 1. Data Structures & Algorithms
Implemented common data structures and algorithms in C# to strengthen problem-solving and coding skills:

- Trees (AVL, Red-Black, Binary Search Tree)  
- Heaps, stacks, queues, and lists  
- Sorting and searching algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, Counting/Radix Sort, Binary Search)  
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Tarjan, Kahn’s, Kosaraju)  

### 2. Miscellaneous Projects
Small-scale coding exercises to practice advanced C# concepts:

- Multithreading and concurrency  
- Delegates, events, and LINQ operations  
- Mathematical and algorithmic challenges  
- Utilities such as calculators, memoization functions, and string/array manipulations  

### 3. Mini Systems & Simulations
Practical mini projects simulating real-world systems:

- Banking notification and payment systems  
- School management and scheduling  
- Translators and task management applications  
- Shop and inventory simulations  

### 4. C Projects
Contains C programs implementing **algorithms and data structures**, including:

- Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, InsertionSort)  
- Graph traversals (DFS, BFS), Graph algorithms  
- Linked lists, vectors, and system-level exercises  

**Concepts Practiced:** pointers, dynamic memory, structs, algorithm implementation
